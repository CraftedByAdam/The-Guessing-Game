🧠 Challenges I Overcame
This was my first real project in my coding journey. I learned:
1. Event Listeners: How to make the page respond to clicks.
2. Data Types: Converting "Text" from an input into a "Number" for math.
3. Responsive Design: Using Media Queries and Percentages instead of fixed pixels.
4. State Management: I learned how to "reset" the game's state (new number, zeroed counter, unlocked buttons) without having to refresh the entire browser page.

🎨 Design
- Fonts: I Used "Gravitas One" for Dark Mode/Light Mode, "Rubik Puddles" for an arcade feel, "Sriracha" for "I am thinking of a number between 1 and 100", "Titan One" for the "Press" button, "Lexend Zetta" for the Too High/Too Low feedback text, "Alumni Sans Pinstripe" for the amount of tries text, and "VT323" for the reset button.
- Animations: Custom CSS transitions for button pushes and card hovers.

📝 How to Play
1. Enter a number between 1 and 100.
2. Click "Press" to submit your guess.
3. Use the feedback to adjust your next guess.

4. Try to win before you run out of 7 tries!
